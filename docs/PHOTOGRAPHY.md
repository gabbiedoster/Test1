These four images were a duo sets that I made Photoshop. The first two represent the light and darkness of a person. The last two share the connection of curiosity. The glowing ball represents the sense of wonder and imagination.

Some people may think heaven is a large blooming field of sunshine and flowers, but my idea is that heaven is free roaming above the clouds. This image was created with Adobe Photoshop.

The first image was made with creative freestyling on Photoshop. The second image is a portrait with the idea of imagination within nature.
