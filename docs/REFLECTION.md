# REFLECTING ON WEBSITE CREATION

By Gabbie Doster


For my Digit 100 class, I am asked to reflect on the process and my opinions on creating two websites. The websites used to create both sites were GitHub and WordPress. Honestly, both sites had their own pros and cons. Overall, this experience in website building was pretty much new to me. I’ve used website creators, such as Wix, for past college courses. GitHub and WordPress taught me new ways to navigate and create a website. 


GitHub was the first website I used to create my portfolio. This was my first experience with coding! Before this assignment I was familiar with what coding was I just personally had no practice with writing code myself. I’m not going to lie, at first coding was extremely frustrating but, it has taught me better patience to achieve a greater outcome. Once you pick up and learn some of the simpler code/keys, it becomes a lot easier to mess around with. My favorite part of using GitHub was finding out how to put images and connecting my YouTube videos in their own directories. The first time around uploading the YouTube videos was tricky therefore, extra frustrating but, after multiple Google searches and asking for help I was able to figure out how to make it work. I’m super proud of my GitHub website and hope to use it as a future reference. 


This was also my first experience with using WordPress. WordPress had an easier learning curve than GitHub did. WordPress was easier to navigate and to fidget with. Compared to GitHub, I liked how WordPress was more visually easier to understand verses the coding you had to complete when using GitHub. Another great aspect of WordPress is the hundreds of options you have when picking out what theme you’d like to use. Having an arrangement allowed me to be more unique and creative. My favorite part about using WordPress was playing around with the headings and adding images to my writings. 


When reviewing both my websites I found that learning how to code was the most significant challenge for me. Now that I’m familiar with it, I feel more comfortable it. I found that WordPress was overall, easier to use. It took me less time creating my website for WordPress than it did GitHub. If I had to choose, I prefer the layout and look of my WordPress site better than my GitHub site. I struggled more using GitHub, for example, learning how to use different markdown files were difficult. Before this assignment I had no idea how to code, now I can happily say that I’ve learned something new. It was different and daunting, but anything is when you first try it. In the future, I’d like to learn how to build my sites either further. As in learning new skills and tools to advance my sites. In the end, I’m happy I’ve got this new experience under my belt. I’ve learned new ways to creatively build a website for either future projects or me.
