# GABRIELLE DOSTER

Hello, welcome to my personal portfolio! 


## ABOUT ME 
<img src="images/selfie.JPG" alt="selfie for about me" width="300"/> 

My name is Gabbie Doster. I'm 20 years old, from Buffalo, NY. I'm currently a junior at Penn State Behrend in Erie, Pennsylvania. My major is Digital Media, Arts, and Technology but, I'm thinking about switching it to Communications. Before Behrend, I attended Erie Community College back in Buffalo. Being a transfer student has really helped open my eyes to the many opportunites I have. I'm passionate about film and videography. I also love taking pictures! Photography holds a special place in my heart. My dream job would be either a director/producer or cinematographer.

These four images were a duo sets that I made Photoshop. The first two represent the light and darkness of a person. The last two share the connection of curiosity. The glowing ball represents the sense of wonder and imagination.

Some people may think heaven is a large blooming field of sunshine and flowers, but my idea is that heaven is free roaming above the clouds. This image was created with Adobe Photoshop.

The first image was made with creative freestyling on Photoshop. The second image is a portrait with the idea of imagination within nature.
