# GABRIELLE DOSTER

Hello, welcome to my personal portfolio! 


## ABOUT ME 
<img src="images/selfie.JPG" alt="selfie for about me" width="300"/> 

My name is Gabbie Doster. I'm 20 years old, from Buffalo, NY. I'm currently a junior at Penn State Behrend in Erie, Pennsylvania. My major is Digital Media, Arts, and Technology but, I'm thinking about switching it to Communications. Before Behrend, I attended Erie Community College back in Buffalo. Being a transfer student has really helped open my eyes to the many opportunites I have. I'm passionate about film and videography. I also love taking pictures! Photography holds a special place in my heart. My dream job would be either a director/producer or cinematographer.
